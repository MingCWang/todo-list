# todo-list

## Description
A quick todo app built with react. 
## What I Learned
During this project, I practiced using state, props, hooks, and component composition in React. I also explored Docker containerization to package and deploy the application consistently. Data was stored in local storage for seamless persistence. Overall, the project enhanced my React skills, introduced me to Docker, and taught me how to manage data effectively.
